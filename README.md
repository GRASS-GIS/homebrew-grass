This [homebrew](https://brew.sh) Tap contains recipes to build [GRASS trunk](https://grass.osgeo.org/development/svn/). They should be working, but nothing is guaranteed!

To use it, you have to first tap the repository:
```
brew tap GRASS-GIS/homebrew-grass-dev
```

after that, you can use

````
brew install --HEAD grass-trunk
````

to install the current development version of GRASS.

All contributions are welcome.

If you have questions, problems, suggestions, etc, please use the issue tracker.
